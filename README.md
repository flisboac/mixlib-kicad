# mixlib-kicad

Assorted symbols and footprints for the ones not afraid to use fancy stuff.

... But in fact, this is just my personal KiCAD component library.


## Credits:

- marbastlib (awesome library, do ckeck it out!)
- keebio
- Mouser, Digikey, etc.
- Everyone uploading stuff to SnapEDA, etc.
- Probably a lot more, for stuff I don't know the origin anymore. (In that case, please let me know!)
